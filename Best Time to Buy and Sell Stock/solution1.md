# Intuition
The problem asks to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a stock. One approach to solve this is to keep track of the minimum price seen so far and calculate the profit that can be obtained by selling at the current price. If the current profit is greater than the maximum profit seen so far, update the maximum profit. This can be done by iterating over the prices array and keeping track of the minimum price and maximum profit seen so far.

# Approach
The approach taken in the provided code is to use a sliding window technique. The left and right pointers start at the beginning of the array. The left pointer represents the minimum price seen so far and the right pointer moves forward to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by selling at the current price. If the current profit is greater than the maximum profit seen so far, update the maximum profit. If the current price is less than the minimum price seen so far, update the minimum price seen so far to the current price. This process is continued until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The code iterates over the array once, so the time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input array.

- Space complexity: The code uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let result = 0;
  let l = 0;
  let r = 1;
  while (r < prices.length) {
    if (prices[l] < prices[r]) {
      result = Math.max(result, prices[r] - prices[l]);
    } else {
      l = r;
    }
    ++r;
  }
  return result;
};
