# Intuition
The problem seems to be a classic example of dynamic programming where we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and combine the solutions to get the final result. Specifically, we can use memoization to avoid recalculating values for the same subproblem.

# Approach
The given code follows the same dynamic programming approach, where we initialize an array of length `n` with 0s. Then, we iterate over the array and calculate the number of steps required to reach the `i+1`th and `i+2`th steps from the `i`th step. We add these calculated values to the `i+1`th and `i+2`th positions in the array. Finally, we return the value at the last index of the array +1, which represents the total number of distinct ways to climb the stairs.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ - We loop through the array once.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ - We create an array of size `n`.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
function climbStairs(n) {
  const steps = Array.from({ length: n }, () => 0);
  const lastIndex = n - 1;

  for (let i = 0; i < lastIndex; ++i) {
    steps[i + 1] = steps[i] + (steps[i - 1] || 0) + 1;
    steps[i + 2] = steps[i + 1] + steps[i] + 1;
  }

  return steps[lastIndex] + 1;
}
