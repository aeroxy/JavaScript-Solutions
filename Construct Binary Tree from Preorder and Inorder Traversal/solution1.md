# Intuition
The idea behind the algorithm is to recursively construct the binary tree from the given preorder and inorder traversals. The first element in the preorder traversal is always the root of the current subtree. We can then find the index of the root in the inorder traversal, which tells us the sizes of the left and right subtrees. We can then recursively construct the left and right subtrees by passing in the appropriate sub-arrays of the preorder and inorder traversals.

# Approach
The implementation uses a recursive approach to build the binary tree. The `buildTree` function takes in the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays as input, and returns the root node of the constructed binary tree.

The function first checks if the `preorder` array is empty. If it is, it returns `null`, since there are no nodes to construct.

It then calls a `reduce` function, which takes in four arguments: `pStart`, `pEnd`, `iStart`, and `iEnd`. These arguments represent the indices of the current subtree in the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays.

The base case of the recursion is when `pStart` is greater than `pEnd`, in which case the function returns `null`.

The function then extracts the root value of the current subtree from the `preorder` array at the `pStart` index. It finds the index of the root in the `inorder` array, which gives us the sizes of the left and right subtrees.

It then creates a new `TreeNode` object with the root value, and recursively constructs the left and right subtrees by calling `reduce` with the appropriate indices. The left subtree's indices are `pStart + 1` and `pStart + leftSize`, and `iStart` and `rootIndex - 1`, respectively. The right subtree's indices are `pEnd - rightSize + 1` and `pEnd`, and `rootIndex + 1` and `iEnd`, respectively.

Finally, the function returns the root node of the constructed binary tree.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm is $$O(n)$$, where n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the construction of the binary tree.
    
- Space complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is $$O(n)$$, where n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we create a new `TreeNode` object for each node in the binary tree, and the maximum depth of the recursion is equal to the height of the binary tree.

    if (pStart > pEnd) {
      return null;
    }
    const top = preorder[pStart];
    const rootIndex = inorder.indexOf(top);
    const leftSize = rootIndex - iStart;
    const rightSize = iEnd - rootIndex;

    return new TreeNode(
      top,
      reduce(pStart + 1, pStart + leftSize, iStart, rootIndex - 1),
      reduce(pEnd - rightSize + 1, pEnd, rootIndex + 1, iEnd),
    );
  };

  const lastIndex = preorder.length - 1;

  return reduce(0, lastIndex, 0, lastIndex);
};
