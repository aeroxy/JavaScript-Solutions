# Intuition
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming. We can use a two-dimensional array to keep track of the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of word1 into the first j characters of word2. The idea is to build the solution bottom-up, starting from the last character of each word and filling in the array as we go.

# Approach
We start by creating a two-dimensional array, `tmp`, with dimensions (word1.length + 1) x (word2.length + 1). The first dimension represents the first i characters of word1, and the second dimension represents the first j characters of word2. We initialize the array with 0 for all positions.

We then iterate over each position in the array, starting from the bottom right corner and moving towards the top left corner. For each position, we check the following:

*   If we have reached the bottom right corner of the array, we skip the current iteration.
*   If we have reached the bottom row of the array (i.e., row = word1.length), then we set the value of the current position to the number of characters remaining in word2 (i.e., lastCol - col).
*   If we have reached the rightmost column of the array (i.e., col = word2.length), then we set the value of the current position to the number of characters remaining in word1 (i.e., lastRow - row).
*   Otherwise, we compare the current characters of word1 and word2. If they are the same, we set the value of the current position to the value of the position one diagonal down and to the right. If they are different, we take the minimum of the values to the right, below, and diagonal down and to the right, and add 1 to it. We set the value of the current position to this minimum.

Finally, we return the value at position (0, 0) of the array, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform word1 into word2.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(m*n)$$, where m is the length of word1 and n is the length of word2. We iterate over all positions in the two-dimensional array once.
- Space complexity: $$O(m*n)$$, for the two-dimensional array `tmp`.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {number}
 */
function minDistance(word1, word2) {
  const tmp = Array.from(
    { length: word1.length + 1 },
    () => Array.from(
      { length: word2.length + 1 },
      () => 0,
    ),
  );
  const lastRow = word1.length;
  const lastCol = word2.length;
  for (let row = lastRow; row >= 0; --row) {
    for (let col = lastCol; col >= 0; --col) {
      if (row === lastRow && col === lastCol) {
        continue;
      }
      if (row === lastRow) {
        tmp[row][col] = lastCol - col;
        continue;
      }
      if (col === lastCol) {
        tmp[row][col] = lastRow - row;
        continue;
      }
      const diagVal = tmp[row + 1][col + 1];
      if (word1[row] === word2[col]) {
        tmp[row][col] = diagVal;
      } else {
        const rightVal = tmp[row][col + 1];
        const bottomVal = tmp[row + 1][col];
        tmp[row][col] = Math.min(rightVal, diagVal, bottomVal) + 1;
      }
    }
  }

  return tmp[0][0];
}
