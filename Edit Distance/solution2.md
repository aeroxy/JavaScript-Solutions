# Intuition
The problem asks us to find the minimum number of operations required to convert one word to another. We can approach this problem using dynamic programming. We can break the problem into subproblems and memoize the result of subproblems to optimize the solution.

# Approach
We can define a recursive function to find the minimum operations required to convert the substrings of both the words. We can use memoization to avoid recomputing the same subproblems. The base cases of the recursion are when either of the substrings becomes empty. In this case, we need to insert the remaining characters of the non-empty substring. If the characters of the substrings are the same, we don't need to do anything. Otherwise, we can try three operations: insert, delete, or replace a character. We can return the minimum of the three operations plus one (to account for the current operation).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n * m)$$, where n and m are the lengths of word1 and word2, respectively. This is because we are computing the minimum operations for each possible pair of indices of the two words.
- Space complexity: $$O(n * m)$$, where n and m are the lengths of word1 and word2, respectively. This is because we are memoizing the results of all possible subproblems in a 2D memoization array.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {number}
 */
function minDistance(word1, word2) {
  const reduce = (index1, index2, memo = {}) => {
    if (index1 < 0) {
      return index2;
    }
    if (index2 < 0) {
      return index1;
    }
    const memoKey = `${index1},${index2}`;
    if (memo[memoKey]) {
      return memo[memoKey];
    }
    if (word1[index1] === word2[index2]) {
      memo[memoKey] = reduce(index1 - 1, index2 - 1, memo);
      return memo[memoKey];
    }
    const insertOps = reduce(index1, index2 - 1, memo);
    const deleteOps = reduce(index1 - 1, index2, memo);
    const replaceOps = reduce(index1 - 1, index2 - 1, memo);
    memo[memoKey] = Math.min(insertOps, deleteOps, replaceOps) + 1;
    return memo[memoKey];
  }
  
  return reduce(word1.length - 1, word2.length - 1) + 1;
}
