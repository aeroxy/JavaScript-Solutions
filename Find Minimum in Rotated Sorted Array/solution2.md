# Intuition
The provided JavaScript code uses a simple approach to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. The idea is to check the first and last elements of the array and determine the faster way to iterate through the array - top down or bottom up.

# Approach
1.  Check if the array would be solved faster by using top down or bottom up by comparing the first and last elements of the array.
2.  If the array is going to be solved faster by iterating through bottom up, iterate through the array from the end and compare each element with the previous one. If an element is less than the previous element, return it as the minimum element.
3.  If the array is going to be solved faster by iterating through top down, iterate through the array from the start and compare each element with the previous one. If no smaller element is found, simply return the first element as the minimum element.

# Complexity
- The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ in the worst case, where n is the length of the array. This is because if the array is not rotated, we need to iterate through the entire array. In practice, this is usually the fastest way to solve this problem because say the rotation is a random number between 0 to the length of the array, then the average time complexity of this solution is $$O(n/4)$$.

- The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ because we are not using any extra space, except for the variables used to store the length of the array and the last element.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMin = function(nums) {
  const n = nums.length - 1;
  if (nums[0] > nums[n]) {
    let last = nums[n];
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
      const num = nums[i];
      if (num > last) {
        return last;
      } else {
        last = num;
      }
    }
    return nums[n];
  } else {
    let last = nums[0];
    for (let num of nums) {
      if (num >= last) {
        last = num;
      } else {
        return num;
      }
    }
    return nums[0];
  }
};
