# Intuition
This problem asks to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. One approach to solve this problem is to use binary search, where we compare the middle element with the first and last elements of the array to determine which side of the array contains the minimum element.

# Approach
The approach used in the provided JavaScript code is binary search. We set two pointers, `start` and `end`, to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. We then use a while loop to iterate until `start` and `end` meet. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index using `Math.floor((start + end) / 2)` and compare the middle element with the last element of the array. If the middle element is less than the last element, we update `end` to `mid`, indicating that the minimum element is on the left side of the array. Otherwise, we update `start` to `mid + 1`, indicating that the minimum element is on the right side of the array. We repeat this process until `start` and `end` meet, at which point we have found the minimum element.

# Complexity
- The time complexity is $$O(log(n))$$ because we are using binary search to find the minimum element in the array. However, this solution is usually slower than the $$O(n/4)$$ iterative solution because the `Math.floor((start + end) / 2)` operation is expensive.

- The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ because we are not using any extra space, except for the variables used to store the indices of the array.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMin = function (nums) {
  let start = 0;
  let end = nums.length - 1;

  while (start < end) {
    const mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
    if (nums[mid] < nums[end]) {
      end = mid;
    } else {
      start = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  return nums[start];
};
