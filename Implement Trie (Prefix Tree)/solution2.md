# Intuition
We can use a hybrid implementation of a Trie using a Set and an Object. The Set is used to store complete words, while the Object is used to store the Trie structure for prefix search. This implementation is not a standard Trie implementation but it can work more efficiently in some cases.

# Approach
1.  The constructor initializes a Set called `words` and an Object called `store`.
2.  The `insert` method adds a word to the `words` Set and builds the Trie structure using the `store` Object. The `store` Object uses nested objects to represent Trie nodes.
3.  The `search` method checks if a word is present in the `words` Set.
4.  The `startsWith` method traverses the Trie structure represented by the `store` Object to check if any word starts with the given prefix.

# Complexity
*   Time complexity:
    *   Insert: $$O(m)$$, where m is the length of the word. This is because we need to iterate through each letter in the word to build the Trie structure.
    *   Search: $$O(1)$$ because the search operation is performed on the Set.
    *   StartsWith: $$O(m)$$, where m is the length of the prefix. This is because we need to traverse the Trie structure based on the prefix length.
*   Space complexity: $$O(n*m+n)$$, where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words. This is because we store all the words in the Set and build the Trie structure using the `store` Object.

# Code
```js
var Trie = function() {
  this.words = new Set();
  this.store = {};
};

/** 
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {void}
 */
Trie.prototype.insert = function(word) {
  this.words.add(word);
  let node = this.store;
  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; ++i) {
    const letter = word[i];
    node[letter] = node[letter] ?? {};
    node = node[letter];
  }
  return null;
};

/** 
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {boolean}
 */
Trie.prototype.search = function(word) {
  return this.words.has(word);
};

/** 
 * @param {string} prefix
 * @return {boolean}
 */
Trie.prototype.startsWith = function(prefix) {
  let node = this.store;
  for (let i = 0; i < prefix.length; ++i) {
    const letter = prefix[i];
    if (!node[letter]) {
      return false;
    }
    node = node[letter];
  }
  return true;
};
