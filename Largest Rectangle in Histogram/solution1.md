# Intuition
The problem is asking to find the largest rectangular area formed by the bars of a histogram. One approach to solve this is to iterate through the bars and consider each bar as the potential height of the rectangle. Then, for each height, we calculate the maximum width that we can have for that height by iterating both sides of the histogram until we reach a bar with a height smaller than the current height. Finally, we compute the area of the rectangle with the current height and width and update the maximum area found so far.

# Approach
We can use a two-dimensional array `tmp` to store the height and size of the rectangle that can be formed using the current height and each of the subsequent heights. For each height `heights[i]`, the solution calculates the maximum size of the rectangle that can be formed using `heights[i]` as the height and each of the subsequent heights as the width. If `heights[j]` is less than `heights[i]`, then we cannot extend the rectangle any further. So, the iteration stops and the maximum size found so far is stored in `tmp[i][1]`. The maximum size of all the rectangles formed using `heights[i]` is then stored in the variable `result`. Finally, the solution returns `result`, which is the maximum size of the rectangle that can be formed by the histogram.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The solution uses a nested loop to iterate through the array `heights` and the subsequent elements for each element. So, the time complexity of the solution is $$O(n^2)$$, where n is the length of `heights`.
    
- Space complexity: The solution uses a two-dimensional array `tmp` to store the height and size of the rectangles. So, the space complexity of the solution is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of `heights`.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */
function largestRectangleArea(heights) {
  const tmp = [];
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; ++i) {
    const height = heights[i];
    tmp[i] = [height, height];
    result = Math.max(result, height);
    for (let j = i + 1; j < heights.length; ++j) {
      if (!heights[j]) {
        break;
      }
      const newHeight = Math.min(tmp[i][0], heights[j]);
      const newSize = newHeight * (j - i + 1);
      result = Math.max(result, newSize);
      tmp[i] = [newHeight, newSize];
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```
