# Intuition
The problem is asking to find the largest rectangular area formed by the bars of a histogram. One approach to solve this is to use a stack to keep track of the bars that can form a rectangle with a height equal to or greater than the height of the current bar. For each bar, we check if it can form a rectangle with any of the bars in the stack. If it can, we calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the two bars and update the maximum area found so far. If it cannot, we add the current bar to the stack. Finally, we pop all the bars from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by each of them and update the maximum area found so far.

# Approach
We use a stack to keep track of the bars that can form a rectangle with a height equal to or greater than the height of the current bar. For each bar `heights[i]`, the solution checks if it can form a rectangle with any of the bars in the stack. If it can, the solution calculates the area of the rectangle formed by the two bars and updates the maximum area found so far. If it cannot, the solution adds the current bar to the stack. Finally, the solution pops all the bars from the stack and calculates the area of the rectangle formed by each of them and updates the maximum area found so far. Finally, the solution returns `result`, which is the maximum size of the rectangle that can be formed by the histogram.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The solution uses a loop to iterate through the array `heights` and the stack. So, the time complexity of the solution is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of `heights`.
    
- Space complexity: The solution uses a stack to keep track of the bars. So, the space complexity of the solution is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of `heights`.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */
function largestRectangleArea(heights) {
  const stack = [];
  let result = 0;

  const checkLastStack = (i, height, x) => {
    const lastStack = stack[stack.length - 1];
    if (!lastStack) {
      height && stack.push([x ?? i, height]);
      return;
    }
    const [lastIndex, lastHeight] = lastStack;
    const width = i - lastIndex;
    if (lastHeight <= height) {
      stack.push([x ?? i, height]);
      return;
    }
    result = Math.max(result, lastHeight * width);
    stack.pop();
    checkLastStack(i, height, lastIndex);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; ++i) {
    const height = heights[i];
    checkLastStack(i, height);
  }

  stack.forEach(([lastIndex, lastHeight]) => {
    const width = heights.length - lastIndex;
    result = Math.max(result, lastHeight * width);
  });

  return result;
}
