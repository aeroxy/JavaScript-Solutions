# Intuition
The problem can be solved by using the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm. We can start by using two pointers (slow and fast), where the slow pointer moves one step at a time and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, then the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, then the fast pointer will reach the end of the list and we can return false.

# Approach
To implement the above approach, we can check if the linked list is empty or if it contains less than 2 nodes. If it does, then there can be no cycle and we can return false. Otherwise, we can initialize the slow and fast pointers to the second and third nodes respectively. We can then iterate over the list, moving the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time, until they meet. If they meet, then there is a cycle in the linked list and we can return true. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, then there is no cycle and we can return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, when there is a cycle in the linked list, both the slow and fast pointers traverse the entire list before they meet. In the best case, when there is no cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer reaches the end of the list in n/2 steps.
    
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, since we are only using constant space to store the slow and fast pointers.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasCycle = function(head) {
  if (!head || !head.next || !head.next.next) {
    return false;
  }
  let slow = head.next;
  let fast = head.next.next;
  while (slow !== fast) {
    if (!slow?.next || !fast?.next?.next) {
      return false;
    }
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }
  return true;
}
```
