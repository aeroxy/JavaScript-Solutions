# Intuition
We need to find the length of the longest symmetric substring by replacing "?" with either "<" or ">". This problem can be solved using backtracking, where we try out all possible combinations of replacing "?" with "<" or ">" and calculate the length of the longest symmetric substring. We will keep track of all possible lengths we encounter and return the maximum of them.

# Approach
We will use backtracking to try out all possible combinations of replacing "?" with "<" or ">". We will start by replacing the first "?" with "<" and the second "?" with ">". Then, we will replace the first "?" with ">" and the second "?" with "<". We will continue doing this for all occurrences of "?" in the string. If we encounter a substring that is not symmetric, we will backtrack and try the other possible replacement for "?".

While we are replacing "?" with "<" or ">", we will keep track of the number of "<"s that we have encountered so far. If we encounter a ">" and we have seen at least one "<" before it, we can form a symmetric substring. We will add the length of this substring to a set of results.

If we encounter a "?" and we have not made a decision on whether to replace it with "<" or ">", we will recursively call the backtrack function twice, once with "<" and once with ">".

# Complexity
*   Time complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is $$O(2^n)$$, where n is the number of "?" in the string. This is because we are trying out all possible combinations of replacing "?" with "<" or ">".
*   Space complexity: The space complexity of this algorithm is also $$O(2^n)$$ because we are storing all possible results in a set.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number}
 */
function solution(S) {
  const results = new Set();

  const backtrack = (i, openLeft = 0, curLen = 0, overRide = '') => {
    for (let j = i; j < S.length; ++j) {
      if (overRide === '<' || S[j] === '<') {
        ++openLeft;
      }
      if ((overRide === '>' || S[j] === '>') && openLeft) {
        --openLeft;
        curLen += 2;
        if (!openLeft) {
          results.add(curLen);
          curLen = 0;
        }
      }

      if (!overRide && S[j] === '?') {
        backtrack(j, openLeft, curLen, '>');
        backtrack(j, openLeft, curLen, '<');
      }

      overRide = '';
    }
    results.add(curLen);
  };

  backtrack(0);

  return Math.max(...results);
}
