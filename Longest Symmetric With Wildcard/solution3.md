# Intuition
We need to find the length of the longest symmetric substring made of "<" and ">" characters. We can solve this problem by checking all possible centers of the string and expanding from those centers. We will keep track of the length of the longest symmetric substring we encounter and return it as the result.

# Approach
We will iterate through the string and for each character, we will treat it as the center of the string and expand from it to check if we can form a symmetric substring. We will do this by expanding to the left and right of the center until we encounter characters that are not "<" or ">" or we reach the beginning or end of the string. If the characters we encounter while expanding are "<" and ">", we can form a symmetric substring. We will keep track of the length of the longest symmetric substring we encounter and return it as the result.

# Complexity
*   Time complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is $$O(n^2)$$ because we are checking all possible centers of the string and expanding from those centers.
*   Space complexity: The space complexity of this algorithm is $$O(1)$$ because we are not using any additional data structures.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number}
 */
function solution(S) {
  if (S.length < 2) {
    return 0;
  }

  const results = new Set();

  let i = 0;
  let j = 1;

  while (j < S.length) {
    let x = i;
    let y = j;
    let curLen = 0;
    while (true) {
      if (
        S[x] === '>' || S[y] === '<' ||
        S[x] === undefined || S[y] === undefined
      ) {
        results.add(curLen);
        curLen = 0
        break;
      }
      curLen += 2;
      --x;
      ++y;
    }
    ++i;
    ++j;
  }

  return Math.max(...results);
}
```
