# Intuition
We need to find the longest symmetric substring by replacing the question marks with "<" or ">". We can iterate through the string and keep track of the counts of the "<", ">", and "?" characters seen so far, as well as whether the last seen character was "<" or ">". We can use this information to calculate the maximum number of consecutive pairs of angle brackets that can be formed given the current counts of "<", ">", and "?" characters. We can update the maximum number of pairs found so far and continue iterating through the string. Finally, we return the maximum number of consecutive pairs of angle brackets found, multiplied by 2.

# Approach
1.  We initialize some variables:
    
    *   `leftCount`: the number of "<" characters seen so far
    *   `rightCount`: the number of ">" characters seen so far
    *   `questionCount`: the number of "?" characters seen so far
    *   `isLeft`: a boolean indicating whether the last seen character was "<"
    *   `maxPairs`: the maximum number of consecutive pairs of angle brackets found so far
    *   `lastQuestionsCount`: the number of "?" characters seen after the last ">"
2.  We define a helper function `calculatePairs()` that calculates the number of consecutive pairs of angle brackets that can be formed given the current counts of "<", ">", and "?" characters. We calculate the number of complete pairs of angle brackets, as well as the number of "<" and ">" characters that are not paired with each other. If there are more "<" characters than "?" characters, we pair as many "?" characters as possible with "<" characters. Otherwise, we pair as many "<" characters as possible with ">" characters, and pair the remaining "?" characters with "<" characters.
    
3.  We iterate through the string `S` and process each character:
    
    *   If the character is "?", we increment the count of "?" characters seen and call `calculatePairs()`.
    *   If the character is "<", we update the counts of "<" and "?" characters seen, and call `calculatePairs()`. If the last seen character was ">", we start a new sequence of "<" and ">" characters, and use the number of "?" characters seen after the last ">" as the starting count for the new sequence.
    *   If the character is ">", we update the count of ">" characters seen and call `calculatePairs()`. If the last seen character was "<", we switch to processing ">" characters.
4.  We process any remaining "?" characters at the end of the string, and call `calculatePairs()`.
    
5.  We return the maximum number of consecutive pairs of angle brackets found, multiplied by 2.

# Complexity
*   Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the string once and perform constant-time operations for each character.
*   Space complexity: $$O(1)$$. We use a constant amount of extra space to store the counts and other variables.
