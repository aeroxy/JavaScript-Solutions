# Intuition
The problem requires finding the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input array of integers. One approach to solving this problem is to use dynamic programming, where we keep track of the maximum and minimum products that can be obtained using the current element and the previous maximum and minimum products. Another approach is to keep track of the maximum product seen so far and update it as we iterate through the input array.

# Approach
We can use three variables to keep track of the current minimum product, current maximum product, and the maximum product seen so far. We initialize all three variables to the first element of the input array. For each subsequent element, we compute the minimum and maximum products that can be obtained using the current element and the previous minimum and maximum products. We update the current minimum and maximum products and the maximum product seen so far based on these values. The maximum product seen so far is the maximum of the current maximum product and the maximum product seen so far.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input array. We iterate through the input array once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$. We use only three variables to store the current minimum product, current maximum product, and maximum product seen so far.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProduct = function(nums) {
  let min = max = result = nums[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    const num = nums[i];
    const a = min * num;
    const b = max * num;
    min = Math.min(num, a, b);
    max = Math.max(num, a, b);
    result = Math.max(result, max);
  };
  return result;
};
```
