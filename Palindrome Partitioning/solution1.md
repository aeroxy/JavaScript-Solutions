# Intuition
The problem requires us to find all possible partitions of the input string such that each substring is a palindrome. We can solve this using a backtracking algorithm. We start at the first character of the string, and try all possible substrings of increasing length that start at that character. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome, and if it is, we add it to our current path and recursively explore the rest of the string starting from the next character. If we reach the end of the string, we add the current path to our result. We repeat this process for each character in the string.

# Approach
- Define an `isPalindrome` function that returns `true` if a given string is a palindrome.
- Define a `result` array to store all possible partitions of the input string.
- Define a `backtrack` function that takes a starting index and a current path as input.
- In the `backtrack` function, if the starting index is equal to the length of the input string, we have found a valid partition, so we add the current path to the `result` array and return.
- Otherwise, we loop through all possible substrings of increasing length that start at the starting index. For each substring, if it is a palindrome, we add it to our current path, recursively call the `backtrack` function with the next starting index, and then remove the last element from our current path.
- Finally, we call the `backtrack` function with a starting index of 0 and an empty path, and return the `result` array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n*2^n)$$, where n is the length of the input string. We have to consider all possible partitions of the input string, and there can be up to $$2^n-1$$ such partitions. For each partition, we need to check if each substring is a palindrome, which takes $$O(n)$$ time.

- Space complexity: $$O(n^2)$$, where n is the length of the input string. This is the maximum amount of space used by the call stack, since we can have at most n recursive calls, and each call can store a path of up to length n.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[][]}
 */
var partition = function (s) {
  /**
   * @param {string} string
   * @return {boolean}
   */
  const isPalindrome = (string) => {
    let left = 0;
    let right = string.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
      if (string.charAt(left) !== string.charAt(right)) {
        return false;
      }
      ++left;
      --right;
    }
    return true;
  };

  const result = [];

  /**
   * @param {number} start
   * @return {boolean}
   */
  const backtrack = (start, path) => {
    if (start === s.length) {
      result.push([...path]);
      return;
    }

    for (let i = start; i < s.length; ++i) {
      const subString = s.substring(start, i + 1);
      if (isPalindrome(subString)) {
        path.push(subString);
        backtrack(i + 1, path);
        path.pop();
      }
    }
  };
  backtrack(0, []);

  return result;
};
```
