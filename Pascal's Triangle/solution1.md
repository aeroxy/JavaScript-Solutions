# Intuition
My first thought is that this can be achieved using dynamic programming. We can start with the first row, which contains just a single element, and then build up the subsequent rows by adding elements based on the previous row. Since each row has one more element than the previous row, we can use a two-dimensional array to store the triangle.

# Approach
The code starts with an empty array to hold the triangle and then loops through each row, adding a new array to the triangle for each row. The code then loops through each element in the row, calculating the value based on the previous row and adding it to the current row. If there is no element in the previous row at the current index, the value is assumed to be zero.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the code seems to be $$O(n^2)$$, where n is the number of rows. This is because there are two nested loops, one for each row and one for each element in the row.

- Space complexity: The space complexity of the code is $$O(n^2)$$, since we are using a two-dimensional array to store the triangle.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number} numRows
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var generate = function(numRows) {
  const result = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < numRows; ++i) {
    result[i] = [];
    const x = i - 1;
    for (let j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
      result[i][j] = (result[x]?.[j - 1] ?? 0) + (result[x]?.[j] ?? 0) || 1;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
