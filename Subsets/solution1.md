# Intuition
The first step is to understand the problem. In this case, we are asked to generate all subsets of an array. A subset is a set of elements that are chosen from the original array.

# Approach
There are a few different ways to solve this problem. One approach is to use a recursive function. A recursive function is a function that calls itself. In this case, we can use a recursive function to generate all subsets of an array by calling itself for each element in the array.

The first step in the recursive function is to generate the empty subset. The empty subset is a subset that contains no elements. The next step is to generate all subsets that include the current element. To do this, we can call the recursive function again, but this time we will pass in the current element and the subset that we have already generated.

The recursive function will continue to call itself until all of the elements in the array have been processed. Once all of the elements have been processed, the recursive function will return all of the subsets that it has generated.

# Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is $$O(2^n)$$, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the recursive function will call itself 2n times.

- The space complexity of this approach is $$O(n)$$, because we need to store the current subset and the subset that we have already generated.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
function subsets(nums) {
  const result = [];
  
  function generateSubset(start, subset) {
    result.push(subset);
    for (let i = start; i < nums.length; ++i) {
      generateSubset(i + 1, subset.concat(nums[i]));
    }
  }
  
  generateSubset(0, []);
  return result;
}
```
