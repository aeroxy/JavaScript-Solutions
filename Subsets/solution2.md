# Intuition
The problem is to generate all possible subsets of an array. A subset is a set of elements from the original array, without changing their order. There can be multiple subsets of an array, and the number of subsets can be calculated as 2^n, where n is the length of the array.

# Approach
To generate all possible subsets of an array, we can use a bit manipulation technique. We can represent each subset as a binary number, where the i-th bit of the binary number is 1 if the i-th element of the array is in the subset, and 0 otherwise. For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3]`, then the subset `[1, 3]` can be represented as the binary number `101`, which is equal to 5 in decimal.

We can generate all possible subsets by iterating over all possible binary numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1, where n is the length of the input array. For each binary number, we can check which bits are set to 1 and include the corresponding elements from the input array in the subset.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the `subsets` function is $$O(2^n)$$, as there are 2^n subsets in the worst case, and we need to generate all of them.
    
- Space complexity: The space complexity of the `subsets` function is $$O(2^n)$$, as we need to store all 2^n subsets in the `result` array.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
function subsets(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = [];
  const numSubsets = Math.pow(2, n);

  for (let i = 0; i < numSubsets; ++i) {
    const subset = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      if ((i & (1 << j)) !== 0) {
        subset.push(nums[j]);
      }
    }
    result.push(subset);
  }
  return result;
}
```
