# Intuition

The problem asks us to find the total number of unique paths that can be taken to reach the bottom-right corner of a `m` x `n` grid, starting from the top-left corner. The robot can only move right or down at any point in time.

One way to solve this problem is by using dynamic programming. We can initialize a 2D grid of size `m` x `n` and set the value of each cell to the total number of unique paths to reach that cell from the bottom-right corner. We can then use this grid to calculate the total number of unique paths to reach the top-left corner by summing the values of the adjacent cells.

# Approach

The approach used in the provided code is based on dynamic programming. It initializes a 2D grid (`map`) of size `m` x `n` and sets the value of each cell to the total number of unique paths to reach that cell from the bottom-right corner of the grid. It then returns the value of the top-left cell, which represents the total number of unique paths to reach the top-left corner of the grid.

The code uses a nested loop to iterate over each cell in the grid, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving towards the top-left corner. For each cell, it calculates the total number of unique paths to reach that cell by summing the values of the adjacent cells (i.e., the cell to the right and the cell below). If a cell is at the bottom or right edge of the grid, it only considers the adjacent cell that exists (i.e., the cell to the right or the cell below).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the provided code is $$O(m*n)$$. This is because the code iterates over each cell in the grid once, and the grid has `m*n` cells.

- Space complexity: The space complexity of the provided code is $$O(m*n)$$. This is because it creates a 2D array (`map`) of size `m` x `n` to store the total number of unique paths to reach each cell in the grid.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
function uniquePaths(m, n) {
  const lastRow = m - 1;
  const lastCol = n - 1;
  const map = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array.from({ length: n }, () => 0));

  for (let row = lastRow; row >= 0; --row) {
    for (let col = lastCol; col >= 0; --col) {
      if (row === lastRow && col === lastCol) {
        map[row][col] = 1;
        continue;
      }
      const rightPos = map[row][col + 1] || 0;
      const bottomPos = map[row + 1]?.[col] || 0;
      map[row][col] = rightPos + bottomPos;
    }
  }

  return map[0][0];
}
