# Intuition
We need to determine whether the given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) or not. A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

One way to solve this problem is to traverse the tree in-order and check whether the resulting sequence of node values is sorted in ascending order. This approach works because in a valid BST, the in-order traversal produces a sorted list of node values.

# Approach
To implement this approach, we can use a recursive function that takes a node and an array representing the current in-order traversal sequence. The function should traverse the left subtree first, then add the current node's value to the sequence, and then traverse the right subtree. We can then check whether the resulting sequence is sorted in ascending order.

However, there's a more efficient approach that doesn't require storing the entire in-order traversal sequence. We can instead use a recursive function that takes a node and two values representing the valid range of values for the node. We start with the range from negative infinity to positive infinity, which allows for any value to be valid for the root node. Then, for each node, we check whether its value is within the valid range and then recursively check its left and right subtrees, updating the valid range accordingly.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We need to visit every node once to determine whether the tree is a valid BST.

- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is dominated by the recursion stack, which can grow as large as the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree could be a skewed tree with all nodes on one side, resulting in a recursion stack of size n.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isValidBST = function(root) {
  const dfs = (node, min, max) => {
    if (!node) {
      return true;
    }
    if (node.val <= min || node.val >= max) {
      return false;
    }
    return dfs(node.left, min, node.val) && dfs(node.right, node.val, max);
  }
  return dfs(root, -Infinity, Infinity);
};
```
