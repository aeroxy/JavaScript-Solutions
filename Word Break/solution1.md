# Intuition
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP) with memoization. We can create a boolean function `dp()` which takes a starting index `start` as its parameter. The function `dp()` returns `true` if the substring of `s` starting from index `start` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

We will use memoization to avoid recomputing the same substring multiple times. We will keep track of the starting indices of substrings that cannot be segmented, and if we encounter the same starting index again, we can return `false` immediately.

# Approach
The function `dp()` takes a starting index `start` as its parameter, and it returns `true` if the substring of `s` starting from index `start` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

The function `dp()` first checks if the starting index `start` is equal to the length of the input string `s`. If it is, then it returns `true` since we have successfully segmented the entire string into words from the dictionary.

If the starting index `start` has been checked before and it was not possible to segment the substring starting from `start` into words from the dictionary, we return `false` immediately, to avoid recomputing the same substring multiple times.

For each starting index `start`, the code loops through all possible substrings of `s` starting from `start` up to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. If the substring exists in the dictionary `wordDict`, the function `dp()` calls itself recursively with the next starting index `end` as its parameter. If the recursive call returns `true`, we return `true` from the current call as well.

Once we have computed the result of `dp(0)`, we can return the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the given recursive approach is $$O(2^n)$$. This is because we are recomputing the same substrings multiple times, leading to overlapping subproblems. The time complexity of the code can be improved by using memoization to avoid recomputing the same substrings multiple times.
    
- Space complexity: The space complexity of the given recursive approach is also exponential. This is because we are creating multiple recursive calls on the call stack, leading to a space complexity of $$O(2^n)$$.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} wordDict
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var wordBreak = function (s, wordDict) {
  const failedStarts = {};
  const dp = (start) => {
    if (start === s.length) {
      return true;
    }
    if (failedStarts[start]) {
      return false;
    }
    const res = [];
    for (let word of wordDict) {
      const end = start + word.length;
      if (s.slice(start, end) === word) {
        res.push( dp(end) );
      }
    }
    if (!res.filter(Boolean).length) {
      failedStarts[start] = true;
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  };
  return dp(0);
};
