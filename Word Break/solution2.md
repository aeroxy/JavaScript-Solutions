# Intuition
The problem is a classic problem of dynamic programming where we need to find if the given string can be segmented into the words of the dictionary. We can solve this problem using the DP approach, where we create a boolean array `dp[]` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Each element of the DP array represents whether the substring of `s` starting from the beginning of the string up to the index `i` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

The recursive approach used in the given code is also a valid approach to solve the problem. The approach is similar to DP approach where we compute the result of the function `dp(start)` recursively.

# Approach
The given code uses a recursive approach with memoization to solve the problem. The function `dp(start)` takes a starting index `start` as its parameter and returns `true` if the substring of `s` starting from index `start` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

The function first checks if the starting index `start` is equal to the length of the input string `s`. If it is, then it returns `true` since we have successfully segmented the entire string into words from the dictionary.

If the starting index `start` has been checked before and it was not possible to segment the substring starting from `start` into words from the dictionary, we return `false` immediately, to avoid recomputing the same substring multiple times.

For each starting index `start`, the code loops through all possible substrings of `s` starting from `start` up to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. If the substring exists in the dictionary `wordDict`, the function `dp()` calls itself recursively with the next starting index `end` as its parameter. If the recursive call returns `true`, we return `true` from the current call as well.

Once we have computed the result of `dp(0)`, we can return the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the given recursive approach with memoization is $$O(n^2)$$, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are computing all possible substrings of `s` starting from `start` up to `n-1`, and for each substring, we are checking if it exists in the dictionary `wordDict`, which takes `O(n)` time in the worst case. We are also memoizing the results to avoid recomputing the same substrings multiple times.
    
- Space complexity: The space complexity of the given recursive approach with memoization is $$O(n)$$, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are using memoization to store the results of the previous computations and retrieving them if the same substring is encountered again. We are also using the `failedStarts` object to keep track of the starting indices of substrings that cannot be segmented into words from the dictionary.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} wordDict
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var wordBreak = function (s, wordDict) {
  const failedStarts = {};
  const dp = (start) => {
    if (start === s.length) {
      return true;
    }
    if (failedStarts[start]) {
      return false;
    }
    for (let i = start; i < s.length; ++i) {
      const string = s.slice(start, i + 1);
      if (wordDict.includes(string) && dp(i + 1)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    failedStarts[start] = true;
    return false;
  };
  return dp(0);
};
