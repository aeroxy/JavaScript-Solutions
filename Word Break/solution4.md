# Intuition
The problem is a classic problem of dynamic programming where we need to find if the given string can be segmented into the words of the dictionary. We can solve this problem using the DP approach, where we create a boolean array `dp[]` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Each element of the DP array represents whether the substring of `s` starting from the beginning of the string up to the index `i` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

# Approach
The boolean array `dp[]` is used to keep track of whether a substring of `s` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`. We start by initializing the last element of the `dp[]` array to `true` since if we can ever get to the last index it means the string can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

We then loop through the string `s` in reverse order, starting from the second last index up to the first index. For each index `i`, we loop through all the words in the dictionary `wordDict` and check if the substring of `s` starting from index `i` starts with the current word. If it does, we check the value of `dp[i + word.length]` and set `dp[i]` to `true` if it is `true`. This means that the substring of `s` starting from index `i` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

Once we have computed the values of `dp[]`, we can return the value of `dp[0]`, which represents whether the entire string `s` can be segmented into words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the DP approach used in the given code is $$O(n^2)$$, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are looping through the string `s` in reverse order, and for each index `i`, we are looping through all the words in the dictionary `wordDict`. The worst-case time complexity is reached when the input string `s` consists of a repeated pattern of characters that do not exist in the dictionary `wordDict`. In this case, we need to compute all possible combinations of substrings of `s`, leading to a time complexity of $$O(n^2)$$.
    
- Space complexity: The space complexity of the given DP approach is $$O(n)$$, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are using an array of size `n+1` to store the results of the DP computation.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} wordDict
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var wordBreak = function (s, wordDict) {
  const dp = Array.from(
    { length: s.length + 1 },
    () => false,
  );
  dp[s.length] = true;

  for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    for (let word of wordDict) {
      if (s.slice(i).startsWith(word)) {
        dp[i] = dp[i + word.length];
      }
      if (dp[i]) {
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[0];
};
